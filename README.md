# Foundry DAO Project

This project was made following along with a lesson from the Cyfrin Foundry course.

## What do we want in this project?

1. A contract controlled by a DAO
2. Every transaction the DAO wants to send has to be voted on
3. This DAO uses ERC20 tokens for voting (Bad model - a better version would be to implement verification of unique participants)
